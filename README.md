# ConwaysGameOfLife

I built this project using Eclipse, and exported it as a runnable jar instead of creating a Maven or Ant build for the sake of simplicity.  The runnable JAR I've provided  in this ZIP is for the Main application which provides a UI built using JavaFX for the purpose of playing a single game or multiple games of Conway's Game of Life.  Simply double-clicking this JAR or running through the Java command line is sufficient (no args necessary).

I provided unlimited looping at the user's discretion, the app supports up to a 60x30 playable grid (a limit I set by common screen resolutions; although it's really only limited by the machine's processing power), and I kept my attention on performance and simplicity.

Happy playing!
